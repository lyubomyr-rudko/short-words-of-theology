Fred asked me to talk - and speak more on how war changed my theology. 

This was the subject that we where sharing during one of our meetings. And I really think that the understanding God and Forgiveness - my theology has changed. And as I was thinking - the theology of sin and forgiveness also wehere viewed under different angles.
